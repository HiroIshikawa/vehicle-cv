# Vehicle CV - On-road vehicle detection and lane finding

Vehicle CV is a CV pipeline that imeplements vehicle detection and lane finding for a self-driving vehicle application.
This is a combined result of the Udacity self-driving car nanodegree projects.

## List of concepts implemented

### Lane finding
- camera calibration
- perspective transform
- gradient threshold
- color threshold
- combined threshold
- sliding window search
- curvature measurement

### Vehicle detection
- color feature
- gradient feature
- HOG feature
- combined feature
- SVM training/classification
- multi-scale window
